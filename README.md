# Clone Google Keep

> Clone google keep application using react as a web app.<br>
> Google keep is a note-taking service.

By developing this app, I focused on react and functional component. I tried to understand an ecosystem of react and optimize its performance, especially reducing unnecessary re-rendering. I also tried to write clean code and logic as much as I could (but I think it was messy in a way ðŸ˜‚).
